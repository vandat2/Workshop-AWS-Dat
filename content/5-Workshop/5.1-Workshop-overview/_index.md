## Context

**Vietnamese Legal RAG Chatbot** is an intelligent question-answering system specialized for Vietnamese legal documents. It allows users to ask legal questions in Vietnamese, retrieves relevant legal clauses from a vector database, and generates accurate answers using Large Language Models (LLM).

The system serves three main user groups: citizens who need quick legal lookup, law students and researchers who need specific legal references, and administrators who manage legal documents, monitor system quality, and manage users. The application includes a FastAPI backend, a Streamlit frontend, and a PostgreSQL database with the pgvector extension.

## Problem Statement

Looking up Vietnamese legal documents currently has major challenges: a large volume of documents spread across many sources, complex legal language that is difficult for ordinary citizens, and the lack of semantic search tools that understand question context. From a technical perspective, traditional keyword-matching chatbot solutions cannot capture the deeper meaning of legal questions, which leads to inaccurate responses.

**Vietnamese Legal RAG Chatbot** addresses this with RAG techniques: converting legal text into vector embeddings, storing them in a vector database (pgvector), and combining semantic retrieval with LLM generation to produce answers with citations. The system architecture is organized into two main flows: **Ingestion Pipeline** and **Query Processing.**

## Architecture Overview

Vietnamese Legal RAG Chatbot uses a **serverless ingestion** architecture combined with a **containerized application** on AWS in Region `ap-southeast-1`. Legal documents are uploaded through S3, processed asynchronously through SQS and Lambda; the application runs on EC2 with Docker Compose; vector data is stored in private RDS PostgreSQL.

### Five Architecture Layers

## Legal Question Processing Flow

When a user asks a legal question, the system performs the following steps:

1. **User sends a question** -> **FastAPI receives the request** and validates JWT token via Cognito.
2. Backend **embeds the question** into a vector using a Vietnamese-specialized SentenceTransformer model.
3. Perform **cosine similarity search** on pgvector to retrieve the top-k relevant legal text chunks.
4. Build a **prompt** with legal context and send it to LLM (Gemini or Bedrock) to **generate an answer**.
5. Return the response with **citations** (legal sources) and **timings_ms** (processing time for each stage).

Simplified flow:

```text
User Question -> JWT Auth -> Embed Query -> pgvector Search
             -> Prompt Construction -> LLM Generation -> Response + Citations
```

## Two Main Processing Pipelines

### Ingestion Flow (Document Pipeline)

When an admin uploads new legal documents, the system processes them asynchronously so it does not affect active user chat experience. Documents are uploaded to **Amazon S3** via presigned URL; S3 event notifications push messages to **Amazon SQS**; an **AWS Lambda** consumer reads the message, downloads the file, performs text chunking with overlapping windows, embeds each chunk, and inserts vectors into **pgvector**. If processing fails, the message is sent to a **Dead Letter Queue** for retry or investigation.

```text
Admin Upload -> S3 Presigned URL -> S3 Bucket -> SQS Queue -> Lambda
           -> Download + Chunk + Embed -> pgvector Insert
           (failure) -> Dead Letter Queue -> Retry/Alert
```

### Query Flow (User Request Flow)

Users access the system through the **Streamlit** UI. The request is sent to the **FastAPI** backend and authenticated using **Cognito** JWT tokens. The backend executes the RAG pipeline: embed query, search pgvector, generate answer. Conversation history is stored in **RDS** with TTL to automatically delete old sessions and reduce storage cost.

```text
User -> Streamlit -> FastAPI (Cognito JWT Auth)
     -> RAG Pipeline (Embed -> Search -> Generate)
     -> RDS (Save conversation history)
     -> Response to User
```

### QAService Processing Flow

`src/rag_core/qa_service.py` is the orchestration center of the RAG pipeline:

1. Receive question from API layer
2. Call `embeddings.py` to embed the question into a 768/1024-dimension vector
3. Call `vector_store.py` to run cosine similarity search on pgvector
4. Call `reranker.py` (if enabled) to cross-encoder rerank top-k -> top-n
5. Call `prompt.py` to build a prompt with legal context
6. Call `generator.py` to send prompt to LLM and receive answer
7. Return response with sources and timings

## Results Achieved

- Completed an end-to-end RAG pipeline for Vietnamese legal documents with high-quality retrieval using Vietnamese-specialized embeddings.
- Deployed the application with Docker Compose on EC2, with Streamlit.
- Delivered dual LLM providers (Google Gemini and Amazon Bedrock) with flexible switching through environment variables.
