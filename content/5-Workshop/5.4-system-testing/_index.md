# System Testing

After deployment, run a short set of end-to-end scenarios before demo.

## 1. Frontend (Streamlit)

| Scenario                            | Expected                                |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Register a new account              | Cognito user created; chat screen opens |
| Login with valid / invalid password | Valid → app; invalid → clear error    |
| Ask a question in chatbot           | Returns`answer` + `sources`         |
| Open source expander                | Shows title / snippet / score           |
| Regular user opens Admin            | Denied or admin UI hidden               |
| Admin opens Dashboard               | KPI / user list visible                 |

## 2. Backend (FastAPI)

| Scenario                                 | Expected                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `GET /`                                | `200` health check          |
| `POST /ask` with `{question, top_k}` | Valid`{answer, sources}`    |
| Call API without token                   | Blocked with`401` / `403` |
| Empty or invalid payload                 | Validation error, no crash    |

## 3. RAG end-to-end

Sample questions: marriage conditions under Vietnamese law; employee rights under the Labor Code.

| Criterion  | Pass when                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Retrieval  | Sources match the question topic       |
| Generation | Answer stays grounded in context       |
| Latency    | Response time is acceptable for a demo |
